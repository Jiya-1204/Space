I created a single-page, responsive React web application.The app offers a curated experience with features like banning photos, exploring viewing history, evaluating image data through interactive visualizations, and saving favorites with custom ratings, enabling users to explore NASA's Astronomy Pictures of the Day (APOD) through the official API.  Users can examine dashboards powered by Recharts that display insights such as rating distributions, media kinds, top contributors, and collection histories. They can also browse specific media information and filter and search their favorite photographs by author, rating, or media type.  For a smooth and long-lasting user experience, the application employs localStorage to store user preferences, React Router for navigation, and responsive CSS in its design.
